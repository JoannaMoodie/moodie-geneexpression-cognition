# moodie-geneexpression-cognition
This repository contains the R scripts that I wrote in support of the preprint "General and specific patterns of cortical gene expression as spatial correlates of complex cognitive functioning". Find the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.16.532915v1). These scripts were run in R version 4.0.2. Please get in touch with me at jmoodie@ed.ac.uk if you have any quesitons.

## Brain regional morphometric profiles of _g_ (general cognitive functioning)
Data: These profiles are calculated with data from 3 cohorts, from which it is possible to request data from: the UK Biobank [data access info here](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/register-apply/), the STratifying Resilience and Depression Longitudinally (STRADL) study, which is part of the Generation Scotland study [data access info here](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/datasets/stratifyin g-resilience-and-depression-longitudinally-stradl-a-dep) and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 [data access info here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/lothian-birth-cohorts/data-access-collaboration).


## Brain regional gene expression profiles
Data: We used French and Paus' Deskian-Killiany cortical regional summary of the Allen Human Brain Atlas data [available here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_FreeSurfer_view_of_the_cortical_transcriptome_generated_from_the_Allen_Human_Brain_Atlas/1439749). 

### Validation of PCA components
Data: The validation based on different pipelines for summarising the Allen Human Brain Atlas data uses data obtained with [Markello et al's scripts](https://github.com/netneurolab/markello_transcriptome) and the [abagen toolbox](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen).
