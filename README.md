# moodie-geneexpression-cognition
This repository contains the R scripts that I wrote in support of the preprint "General and specific patterns of cortical gene expression as spatial correlates of complex cognitive functioning". Find the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.16.532915v1). These scripts were run in R version 4.0.2. Please get in touch with me at jmoodie@ed.ac.uk if you have any quesitons.

## Gene expression
We used French and Paus' Deskian-Killiany cortical regional summary of the Allen Human Brain Atlas data [available here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_FreeSurfer_view_of_the_cortical_transcriptome_generated_from_the_Allen_Human_Brain_Atlas/1439749). 

### Validation of PCA components
The validation based on different pipelines for summarising the Allen Human Brain Atlas data uses data obtained with [Markello et al's scripts](https://github.com/netneurolab/markello_transcriptome) and the [abagen toolbox](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen).
